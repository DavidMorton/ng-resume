# What is this thing!?!?

This is an early experiment of mine with my resume. Before I got a job full time doing angularjs, I experimented with angularjs by putting my resume online. I'm actually pretty proud of the format, which I still use today. Some of the CSS in here is set up specifically to make printing work properly, so someone could visit the site, and print the resume, and that's that. 

The AWS site has long been taken down, but this repository remains. Maybe someday I'll snazz it up again, and put it back out there.
